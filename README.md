# claude-desktop-buddy

Claude for macOS and Windows can connect Claude Cowork and Claude Code to
maker devices over BLE, so developers and makers can build hardware that
displays permission prompts, recent messages, and other interactions. We've
been impressed by the creativity of the maker community around Claude -
providing a lightweight, opt-in API is our way of making it easier to build
fun little hardware devices that integrate with Claude.

> **Building your own device?** You don't need any of the code here. See
> **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** for the wire protocol: Nordic UART
> Service UUIDs, JSON schemas, and the folder push transport.

As an example, this is a desk pet that runs on M5Stack stick devices — the
ESP32 **M5StickC Plus** and the ESP32-S3 **M5StickS3**. It lives off
permission approvals and interaction with Claude: it sleeps when nothing's
happening, wakes when sessions start, gets visibly impatient when an approval
prompt is waiting, and lets you approve or deny right from the device.

## Hardware

This fork runs on **two boards from one codebase**, built on
[M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified), which auto-detects the
board at runtime:

| Board | MCU / peripherals | PlatformIO env |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M5StickC Plus** (original) | ESP32 + AXP192 + MPU6886 | `m5stickc-plus` |
| **M5StickS3** | ESP32-S3 + M5PM1 + BMI270 + ST7789P3 + ES8311 | `m5stack-sticks3` |

The upstream firmware depended on the board-specific `M5StickCPlus` library,
which doesn't support the ESP32-S3. Migrating to M5Unified adds M5StickS3
support while keeping the original StickC Plus working — see
[What this fork changes](#what-this-fork-changes).

## What this fork changes

This fork ports the firmware to the **M5StickS3 (ESP32-S3)** while keeping the
original M5StickC Plus working.

**Board / build**

- Migrated from the `M5StickCPlus` library to **M5Unified** (supports both
  boards, auto-detects at runtime).
- Added the `m5stack-sticks3` PlatformIO environment plus an 8MB partition
  table (`partitions_8mb.csv`) with a large LittleFS region for characters.
- New [`src/compat.h`](src/compat.h) shim maps the legacy APIs the code used
  onto M5Unified / M5GFX:
  - `TFT_eSprite` → `M5Canvas`; render targets → `lgfx::LGFXBase`
  - `M5.Axp.*` → `M5.Power.*`; `M5.Imu.getAccelData` → `getAccel`;
    `M5.Beep` → `M5.Speaker`
  - software RTC over the ESP32 system clock (the StickS3 has no RTC chip)
  - onboard-LED calls are no-ops on the StickS3 (it has no user LED — GPIO10
    there is the Grove port)

**Bug fixes surfaced on the S3**

- `dataPoll` no longer hangs the firmware: the serial drain is now driven by
  `read()`'s `-1` sentinel instead of `available()`, which on the S3's native
  USB-CDC could report bytes `read()` can't deliver and spin forever.
- `Serial.setTxTimeoutMs(0)` so USB-CDC writes don't block when no serial
  monitor is attached.
- `LittleFS.begin(true)` formats a fresh S3 partition on first boot.

**Behavior**

- BLE pairing uses **LE Secure Connections with passkey entry**, as
  REFERENCE.md specifies: the stick displays a six-digit code and the host
  prompts for it. An earlier revision of this fork had downgraded it to Just
  Works over a Windows pairing problem; that also gave up MITM protection on
  a link carrying transcript snippets and tool-call hints, and on macOS the
  passkey flow negotiates fine.
- Approval screen redesigned: the panel sizes to its content and shows the
  tool name + command in larger, readable text.
- **The Grove port is left unpowered on both boards.** Nothing here drives
  it, and `M5.begin()` otherwise runs the 5V boost converter unloaded off the
  battery — enough on the StickS3 to cancel out the charge current entirely.
  If you attach a Grove peripheral, drop the `cfg.output_power = false` line
  in `setup()`.

## Flashing

Install
[PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/).
The repo defines two build environments (default: `m5stack-sticks3`); select
your board with `-e`:

```bash
# M5StickS3 (ESP32-S3)
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t upload

# M5StickC Plus (original ESP32)
pio run -e m5stickc-plus -t upload
```

Add `--upload-port COM6` (Windows) or `--upload-port /dev/ttyACM0`
(Linux/macOS) if auto-detection picks the wrong port.

**M5StickS3:** no button presses needed — the S3 has no DTR/RTS reset line,
so `scripts/sticks3_upload.py` drives download mode over a 1200-baud touch
and boots the board again with a watchdog reset. Close any serial monitor
first; a process holding the port makes esptool fail partway through the
write with an error that points nowhere near the cause.

If a board is running something that ignores the touch (factory UIFlow2, or
an image whose USB never came up), enter download mode by hand: **hold the
side button about two seconds and release** — the green LED blinks when it
takes.

See [docs/sticks3.md](docs/sticks3.md) for the board's other differences and
for what the desktop bridge actually puts on the wire.

To wipe a previously-flashed device first:

```bash
pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t erase && pio run -e m5stack-sticks3 -t upload
```

Once running, you can also wipe everything from the device itself: **hold A
→ settings → reset → factory reset → tap twice**.

## Pairing

To pair your device with Claude, first enable developer mode (**Help →
Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**). Then, open the Hardware Buddy
window in **Developer → Open Hardware Buddy…**, click **Connect**, and pick
your device from the list. macOS will prompt for Bluetooth permission on
first connect; grant it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/menu.png" alt="Developer → Open Hardware Buddy… menu item" width="420">
  <img src="docs/hardware-buddy-window.png" alt="Hardware Buddy window with Connect button and folder drop target" width="420">
</p>

Once paired, the bridge auto-reconnects whenever both sides are awake.

If discovery isn't finding the stick:

- Make sure it's awake (any button press)
- Check the stick's settings menu → bluetooth is on

## Controls

|                         | Normal               | Pet         | Info        | Approval    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **A** (front)           | next screen          | next screen | next screen | **approve** |
| **B** (right)           | scroll transcript    | next page   | next page   | **deny**    |
| **Hold A**              | menu                 | menu        | menu        | menu        |
| **Power** (left, short) | toggle screen off    |             |             |             |
| **Power** (left, ~6s)   | hard power off       |             |             |             |
| **Shake**               | dizzy                |             |             | —           |
| **Face-down**           | nap (energy refills) |             |             |             |

The screen auto-powers-off after 30s of no interaction (kept on while an
approval prompt is up). Any button press wakes it.

## ASCII pets

Eighteen pets, each with seven animations (sleep, idle, busy, attention,
celebrate, dizzy, heart). Menu → "next pet" cycles them with a counter.
Choice persists to NVS.

## GIF pets

If you want a custom GIF character instead of an ASCII buddy, drag a
character pack folder onto the drop target in the Hardware Buddy window. The
app streams it over BLE and the stick switches to GIF mode live. **Settings
→ delete char** reverts to ASCII mode.

A character pack is a folder with `manifest.json` and 96px-wide GIFs:

```json
{
  "name": "bufo",
  "colors": {
    "body": "#6B8E23",
    "bg": "#000000",
    "text": "#FFFFFF",
    "textDim": "#808080",
    "ink": "#000000"
  },
  "states": {
    "sleep": "sleep.gif",
    "idle": ["idle_0.gif", "idle_1.gif", "idle_2.gif"],
    "busy": "busy.gif",
    "attention": "attention.gif",
    "celebrate": "celebrate.gif",
    "dizzy": "dizzy.gif",
    "heart": "heart.gif"
  }
}
```

State values can be a single filename or an array. Arrays rotate: each
loop-end advances to the next GIF, useful for an idle activity carousel so
the home screen doesn't loop one clip forever.

GIFs are 96px wide; height up to ~140px stays on a 135×240 portrait screen.
Crop tight to the character — transparent margins waste screen and shrink
the sprite. `tools/prep_character.py` handles the resize: feed it source
GIFs at any sizes and it produces a 96px-wide set where the character is the
same scale in every state.

The whole folder must fit under 1.8MB —
`gifsicle --lossy=80 -O3 --colors 64` typically cuts 40–60%.

See `characters/bufo/` for a working example.

If you're iterating on a character and would rather skip the BLE round-trip,
`tools/flash_character.py characters/bufo` stages it into `data/` and runs
`pio run -t uploadfs` directly over USB.

## The seven states

| State       | Trigger                     | Feel                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sleep`     | bridge not connected        | eyes closed, slow breathing |
| `idle`      | connected, nothing urgent   | blinking, looking around    |
| `busy`      | sessions actively running   | sweating, working           |
| `attention` | approval pending            | alert, **LED blinks**       |
| `celebrate` | level up (every 50K tokens) | confetti, bouncing          |
| `dizzy`     | you shook the stick         | spiral eyes, wobbling       |
| `heart`     | approved in under 5s        | floating hearts             |

> On the **M5StickS3** the attention **LED** doesn't apply — that board has no
> user LED. Everything else behaves the same.
